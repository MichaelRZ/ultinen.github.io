This is a class project for Fordham University’s “MUSC 1100 R04”, or “Intro to Latin Music History”. Data was gathered with spotify’s API and put through numerous R scripts based on associated artists and terms found from tracks in spotify’s regional top 200 over the course of a week, which equates to around 30,000 different songs.

Questions can be directed to mriadzaky@fordham.edu.
